    <h3>A dense, excellent, and definitely indulgent bread.</h3>
    <p>This banana nut bread is always completely gone in minutes. It's great at parties, but never lasts long at home. Warning: EBNB may be impossible to resist!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredient--list">
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
      <li>2 cups mashed overripe bananas</li>
      <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps--list">
      <li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9x5-inch loaf pans.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Sift flour, baking soda, and salt into a large bowl.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Cream sugar and butter together in a separate bowl. Stir in bananas, eggs, and walnuts until well blended.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Pour wet ingredients into flour mixture and stir just until blended. Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared pans.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until a paring knife inserted into the crown of each loaf comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Remove from the oven and let loaves cool in the pans for at least 5 minutes. Turn out onto a cooling rack, and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Slice and serve. For more intense flavor, wrap each loaf in aluminum foil to keep in the moisture, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
